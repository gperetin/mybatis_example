DESCRIPTION
===========
This is example project that demonstrates use of MyBatis data mapper framework.
Example is using XML to define mappings, I find it less readable when 
using annotations, but feel free to change this.

The program simply persists an entity (Person) to database and then fetches it from database.

Only thing you need to do to run this example is to setup a database.
This example assumes following:
- PostgreSQL database installed on localhost and listening on port 5432
- Database named mybatis_test
- user "mybatis" with password "mybatis" (without the quotes) with read/write 
	permissions on mybatis_test database

You can configure your own setup in mybatis-config.xml file.

TODO
===========
- Integrate with DI container (Guice)
- Use Guice's transaction management
- Use DI to get SqlSessionFactory
- Move DB configuration out of mybatis-config.xml (use ConnectionPool provided by Application Server)
